# TODO

## POSIX

* Windows stat.rs, allowed to fail if file no longer exists
* Cargo nextest run -p iceoryx2 --test service_tests gracefully
    * Service should not be in corrupted state when listed and currently being
    removed

## Bugs

* `posix::Mutex`
    * Implement priority ceiling
* File::read_to_string & File::read_range_to_string, check that there are no
  invalid UTF-8 characters contained
* Verify ACL_LIST_CAPACITY in POSIX_config
* Unix datagram socket, sending credentials and file descriptors no longer works
    * Was introduced with Rust 1.71.0
    * Activate unit test below again fn
    `unix_datagram_socket_sending_receiving_with_max_supported_fd_and_credentials_works`
* `MAX_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES` in shared_memory_directory/mod.rs can lead to stack
  overflow when too large in
  `unsafe { files.write(FileReferenceSet::default()) };` We require placement
  new!
  ```rust
  ptr->write(MaybeUninit<MyThing>::new());
  (ptr as *mut MaybeUninit<MyThinkg>)->do_stuff_to_Initialize_yourself();
  ```
* Better interrupt signal handling. The interrupt signal shall be always
  propagated up to the user for better CTRL+C handling etc.
* `condition_variable` has spurious wakeups on windows since WaitOnAddress with
  a timeout does not really work. Remove ignore for windows from condition
  variable tests and fix problem.
* `CTRL+c` does not work in windows, all examples do not clean up
* `Directory`, `Path`, `FileName`, `FilePath` cannot handle UTF-8 file names
    * `Directory` panics when a directory contains non-ascii (UTF-8) characters
* Windows: `publisher::zero_copy::publisher_block_when_unable_to_deliver_blocks`
  seems to sometimes deadlock

## Default Setup - without configuration & Grouping Support

* Goal: multiple concepts share the same resources
    * ?introduce second name in NamedConcept, the group as FileName?
* Create dynamic shared memory abstraction (below concept layer)
    * Must be able to dynamically resize (grow and shrink)
    * Requires sophisticated allocator that can handle arbitrary sizes
    * Must be emulate some kind of file system
        * Idea is that the concept can use this construct to create and open
      specified instances via name
* Use dynamic shared memory

## Performance

* `mpmc_container`, `mpmc_unique_index_set`, try to avoid constant
  `verify_memory_initialization` call

## Important Questions

* Free list approach, what happens when publisher goes out of scope before
  subscriber does?
* `RelocatableContainer`, make this trait somehow unmovable.
* `ServiceStaticConfig`, pack individual communication pattern configs into
  `MessagingPattern`
* `Performance` and `Safety Critical` mode
    * Default clock is in performance mode Realtime
* Revisit concept abstraction trait structure?
    * Maybe: `concept_name.rs`
        * Contains trait and all impls as pubs under same namespace
* `DynamicStorage`
    * Restrict `T` to
    <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/intrinsics/fn.needs_drop.html> non dropable

## Advanced

* Make relative_ptr/OffsetRepository lock-free
* Introduce deadline timer
* Bitset enums like iceoryx2_bb_POSIX::Permission require const construction
  with bitset operations
* Make POSIX shared memory resizable with `mremap` & `ftruncate`, see:
  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40398901/resize-posix-shared-memory-a-working-example>
* Use `Kani`, `loom` and `miri` for lock-free code testing

## Containers

* `FilePath`/`Path` check that every single entry is not longer than
  `FILENAME_LENGTH`
* Implement `StackBox` where the box max size is provided as generic user
  argument
    * Use it in allocator Memory cleanup function
* Introduce string
* Introduce vector
* Introduce list
* Introduce red-black-tree
* Introduce set
* Introduce hashmap

## Concurrent

* Lock-free list
    * Use unique index set as base
* Introduce `ThreadPool`
    * Introduce `ActiveObject`

## IPC

* POSH/IPC/service
    * Unique global service list file
        * New service must add entry there, on remove, remove entry

## Open Problems

* `iceoryx2_config` use lock free singleton approach from `iceoryx2`
* Remove `ENAMETOOLONG` and replace it with a path/filename string with maximum
  size
    * See `unlink`, `does_file_exist`
* `Semaphore`
    * Implement `timedwait` with GNU libc `sem_clockwait`
* `ReadWriteMutex`
    * Implement `timedwait` with GNU libc `pthread_rwlock_clockrdlock`.
    `pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock`
* Publisher delivers history only when calling send
    * New subscriber may waits a long time when send is not called
